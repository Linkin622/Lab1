- Started coding the program very late, had some trouble understanding what we had to do. Had to ask a friend and read slack notes
to get a better grip of understanding.
- Wasn't getting any values for PARENT tUSER, PARENT tSYS, CHILD tUSER, and CHILD tSYS, but the professor said it was fine.
- Getting small warning errors but im ignoring them because of time.

(2/29/2020)
- Finished program and it runs properly.
